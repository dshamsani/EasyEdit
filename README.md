### I am providing you with my test project called EasyEdit. This project did not have a designer (I'm sorry), in this project I implemented my skills related to working on the backend using express + prisma ORM on the server side and ReactJS on the client side. The idea of the project is simple, it's something like a CMS. After successful registration and authorization, the user will be able to create their own tables (which turn into Prisma models), add any data to them and change them as you like. Each user will have their own tables that will be available only to him. This project was originally created for study and in the future, I'm going to make projects much better and better! Thanks for your attention
