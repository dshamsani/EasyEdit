# Hi there, I'm [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dshamsani/)

### I am providing you with my test project called EasyEdit. This project did not have a designer (I'm sorry), in this project I implemented my skills related to working on the backend using express + prisma ORM on the server side and ReactJS on the client side.
